00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,969
Take a moment to decide any reasons you can think of that would be

2
00:00:02,969 --> 00:00:05,160
compelling for doing such a thing.

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:08,890
Let me show you one example of why it might be a good reason to do this.

4
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:13,210
Basically, it's rarely the case that any piece of logic is so simple as what we

5
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:16,190
see here, and you probably don't want to retype it over and over.

6
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:18,220
So what if our code instead of this?

7
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:21,340
Obviously, I would not want to type all of this code everytime I

8
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:22,900
intended to move a car around.

9
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:25,850
And, by abstracting it out into a function, it makes it much simpler for

10
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:28,680
me to just issue the intent that I have and

11
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,330
have that result in all of the changes that are appropriate.

12
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:35,300
But an even more important reason is to improve your experience of

13
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:37,660
refactoring your code down the line.

14
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:41,800
If you decide you want to change how cars in the program are supposed to move,

15
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,050
then there is only one part of this code that you will need to edit.

16
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:46,950
It will just happen correctly in both of the places where you

17
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:48,420
called that function.

18
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:52,410
Imagine you wanted to alter the way in which your cars move around the program,

19
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:56,080
and you added an equation like this, which happens to be nonsense, but

20
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:58,610
let's say, you had something meaningful you wanted to put in there.

21
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:01,520
If all the movement logic was in one place like this,

22
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,430
you can be confident after you've edited this function that you've made

23
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:07,620
all the changes you need in order for your program to start working correctly.
